    "\n",
    "Na última aula, falamos sobre alguns métodos de seleção de atributos, com maior foco em técnicas de filtro e embutidas. Hoje, vamos finalizar nosso conteúdo de seleção de atributos explorando algumas técnicas de envelopamento ou *wrappers*.\n",

    "- Principais técnicas de seleção de atributos por *wrapping*\n",

    "## **1. Wrapping**\n",
    "\n",
    "No método de envelopamento, *wrapping*, diferentes combinações de atributos são testadas em relação à alguma métrica de desempenho, e utilizando-se um modelo de machine learning. Depois do treinamento, o desempenho de todas os modelos treinados com as diferentes combinações de atributos é comparado, e seleciona-se aquela combinação que apresentar o melhor desempenho.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apesar de utilizar o resultado de modelos, assim como as técnicas de *embedding*, as técnicas *wrapper* realizam a seleção dos atributos **durante o treinamento dos modelos**, enquanto que as técnicas **wrapper** realizam a seleção dos atributos **antes do treinamento iniciar**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Os métodos mais conhecidos são:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Forward selection - [SequentialFeatureSelector](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SequentialFeatureSelector.html) <br>\n",
    "* Backward elimination - [SequentialFeatureSelector](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SequentialFeatureSelector.html), [RFE](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFE.html#sklearn.feature_selection.RFE) <br>\n",

    "### 1.1. **Foward Selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "Etapas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Começa com um modelo que não contém variáveis (chamado de Null Model)\n",
    "2) Faz um modelo com cada uma das features separadamente\n",
    "3) Escolhe a feature mais significativa\n",
    "4) Roda modelos com a feature selecionada e adicionando mais uma\n",
    "5) Escolhe o melhor modelo\n",
    "6) Repete processo 4 e 5 até acabarem as features\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1.2. **Backward Selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "Etapas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Roda um modelo com todas as features\n",
    "2) Escolhe a feature menos significativa e elimina ela\n",
    "3) Roda um modelo com as features restantes\n",
    "4) Repete o processo 2 e 3 sequencialmente\n",
    "\n",
    "A vantagem do Backward Selection é considerar a interação entre as features antes de eliminá-las, mas se o número de features for muito grande a seleção pode demorar demais.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    " ### 1.3. **Bi-directional Elimination**\n",
    "\n",
    "Muito semelhante ao Foward selection, mas ao adicionar uma nova variável ele verifica a importantância de todas as features e se encontrar alguma com significância menor que a determinada previamente, remove essa feature específica por meio do Backward Elimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Portanto, é uma combinação de seleção para frente e eliminação para trás.\n",
    "\n",
    "Etapas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Determine um nível de significância para adicionar e remover features do modelo (por exemplo, significancia_add = 0,05 e significancia_remove = 0,05 com 95% de confiança).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Execute a próxima etapa do Foward Selection (a feature recém-adicionada deve ter valor p-value < significancia_add para entrar).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Execute todas as etapas de eliminação para trás. Ou seja, qualquer recurso adicionado anteriormente com p-value > significancia_remove será removido do modelo).\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Repita as etapas 2 e 3 até obtermos um conjunto final ótimo de recursos.\n",

    "## **2. Recursive Feature Elimination**\n",
    "\n",
    "Conheceremos agora o método **Recursive Feature Elimination** (RFE).\n",
    "\n",
    "O RFE é um método que se utiliza de um estimador capaz de atribuir um score de **importância** a cada uma das features.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Por exemplo, podemos olhar para os coeficientes de um modelo linear (`coef_`), ou então, para os scores de importância de features (`feature_importances_`). Esse método só irá funcionar se o estimador escolhido retorna `coef_` ou `feature_importances_`.\n",
    "\n",
    "O método então considera recursivamente **subconjuntos cada vez menores de features**, da seguinte maneira:\n",
    "\n",
    "- O estimador é treinado inicialmente com todas as features;\n",
    "- A importância de cada uma das features é calculada;\n",
    "- As features menos importantes são retiradas do conjunto de features;\n",
    "- O processo recomeça, até que o número  desejado de features seja alcançado.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sendo assim, temos dois hiperparâmetros importantes na classe [RFE](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFE.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `estimator`: o estimador que irá disponibilizar os scores de importância de features;\n",
    "- `n_features_to_select`: a quantidade de features que o subconjunto final terá.\n",
    "\n",
    "Na prática, podemos utilizar um gridsearch para otimizar estes dois hiperparâmetros, ou então utilizar a classe [RFECV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFECV.html), que determina o melhor número de features automaticamente."

    "este método, utilizamos a função [`sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance.html), que vai criar permutações das features, mantendo um registro do score. O permutation_importance é definido como a diminuição no score de um modelo quando uma única feature é embaralhada aleatoriamente. Este procedimento quebra a relação entre a feature e o target e utiliza a queda na pontuação do modelo como um indicativo de quanto o modelo depende dessa feature.\n",
